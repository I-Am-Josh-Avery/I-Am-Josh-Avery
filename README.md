## Hey, I'm Josh -- Welcome to my GitHub Page!

### Quick overview of what's happening in my world:
- 🔭 I'm practicing problem solving with data structures on [![HackerRank](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Hackerrank-2EC866?style=for-the-badge&logo=HackerRank&logoColor=white)](https://www.hackerrank.com/joshavery57) to prepare for interviews
- 🌱 I'm learning Python, Git, and intermediate-advanced statistics

I'm currently:
- an undergraduate student at Texas State University (studying Math and Business Analytics),
- working as a Math Tutor at my university,
- performing research over warehouse ergonomics, and
- aiming to break into the world of Data Science.


I love learning new things, making discoveries, and sharing them with people. These are the reasons why I'm in my field: Data Science and Math are languages for discovery. My current position allows me to express my love for math to people who are perhaps not as familiar with the subject and watch as their faces light up with the joy of understanding. 
There's so much fascinating and captivating about this world; you just have to go out and find it. 

> In fact, the deeper structure of nature is not modeled out of an examination of data obtained by measurement… The deeper description of nature is achieved by taking weird objects from the frontiers of mathematics — these things dreamed up in the confines and depths of the human mind and inside computers and then laying them over nature and seeing the 1:1 correspondence between, let us say, the multidimensional catastrophes described by René Thom and the dripping of a faucet, the turbulence in a brook, the voting patterns in a ghetto — all of these things are seen to be easily modeled by extremely exotic mathematical objects discovered by intuition in the mind.
