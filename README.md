## Hey, I'm Josh -- Welcome to my GitHub Page!

### Quick overview of what's happening in my world:
- ðŸ”­ Searching for Associate Statistician positions or positions that deal with optimization problems (LP, ILP, MOLP, etc..)
- ðŸŒ± Creating a computer cluster using Raspberry Pis to get practice with parallel programming and distributed computing

### About Me
- ðŸ’» I currently work as a data analyst at Mensor, LP. The 'typical day' doesn't exist: I do everything from building internal tools (usually in visual C#) to cleaning data to applied machine learning. The variety keeps things interesting! ðŸ˜„
- ðŸ¥¾ When I'm not working, I like hiking, reading, and creating, whether that mean painting, tinkering with hardware, or playing my bass guitar.

> In fact, the deeper structure of nature is not modeled out of an examination of data obtained by measurementâ€¦ The deeper description of nature is achieved by taking weird objects from the frontiers of mathematics â€” these things dreamed up in the confines and depths of the human mind and inside computers and then laying them over nature and seeing the 1:1 correspondence between, let us say, the multidimensional catastrophes described by RenÃ© Thom and the dripping of a faucet, the turbulence in a brook, the voting patterns in a neighborhood â€” all of these things are seen to be easily modeled by extremely exotic mathematical objects discovered by intuition in the mind.
